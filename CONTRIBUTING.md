## What should I know before I get started?
- TypeScript
  TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.You can learn more about it in [Click here](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_intro.php).

- Angular
  Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:

- A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
- A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
- A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
  With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with minimal effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.

## How Can I Contribute?
- reporting bugs
  This section guides you through submitting a bug report for link Analysor. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.
- How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

  - Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Project, e.g. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Project, and if so which one?
  - Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
  - Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
